# 0.1.19 `coming soon`

## Key Modifications
* Fixed `vf.pp.writeFixedPaths()`, which previously used incorrect indexing inside the function, causing the unintended removal of important and nonredundant contigs.
* Merged the `vf.pp.update_mkCNSdir_missingEdge()` function into `vf.pp.mkCNSdir()`. Users should now use `vf.pp.mkCNSdir()` exclusively to generate the directory for running verkko-consensus. If you have inserted a new node using `vf.tl.insertGap()` during gap filling, please run this with `missingEdge=True`. For more details, refer to the function's description.


## What's New?


## Fixes and Updates
* The `vf.pp.searchNode()` function now reports. `No paths found` if the specified list of nodes is not present in the graph.
* `vf.tl.calQV()` now includes new parameters: `showOnly=False`, `trio=False`, and `contig_prefix=["dam", "sire"]`. Please refer to the API section for details.
